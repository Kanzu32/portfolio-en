# [ðŸ“–GitHub Compiler](https://github.com/Kanzu32/Compiler)

## Description
Model programming language compiler. The application includes lexical, syntactic, semantic analysis and translation into Polish inverse notation. The result of the application is to search for errors in the written code and translate the model language into a low-level language (NASM) with the ability to compile into an executable file.

The grammar of the language is described in the file `grammar.txt`, which lists all terminal and non-terminal symbols and rules of the language.

## Features
* Lexical, syntactic and semantic analysis;
* Translation into Polish inverse recording;
* Conversion to assembly code;
* Compiling exe file.

## Technologies
* Python;
* Assembler (NASM).
